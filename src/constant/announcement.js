      title: `DISCLAIMER: BSU Vice-Chancellor Disowns Social Media Accounts `,
      date: 'July 2, 2023',
      note: `It has come to the attention of Management of Benue State University that some fraudsters have opened some social media accounts (WhatsApp and Facebook) with the view to defraud members of the public through promise of contract awards and employment.
  
      To entice unsuspecting members of the public to their trap, the fraudsters have created a pseudo conversation engagement between the Vice-Chancellor and some imposters as contractors taking advice from the Vice-Chancellor on how to submit quotations or bid successfully for various items.
      
      One of such fake Facebook accounts has been opened using a mobile telephone number +2348133826128.
      In view of this, the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Tor Joe Iorapuu has alerted members of the public to disregard any such contents on social media so as not to fall prey to the sinister motives of the scammers.
      
      For the avoidance of doubt, the university is not conducting any employment exercise at the moment and even when it is to be done, such advertisements must be done using formal channels and not just social media. Additionally, monetary conditions are not attached to either employment or admission cases as these cheats would like the public to think.
      
      In the same vein, advertisement of tenders for contract awards by the University, particularly those of TETfund, are published in the Federal Tenders Journal, the University website and other Traditional media channels.
      
      Meanwhile, the University has alerted the relevant security agencies and mobile Networks to use relevant tools at their disposal to arrest the miscreants and treat these cases in accordance with provisions in the relevant laws.`,

      title: `UTME Forgery: Mmesoma Ejikeme begs JAMB for forgiveness`,
      date: 'July 2, 2023',
      note: `“I strongly seek your forgiveness for the mistake I made. Words alone cannot describe the pain I feel for letting you down. This is the first time in my life and academic journey that I will be accused of any wrongdoing," Miss Ejikeme said.
      ByBakare Majeed  July 19, 2023 Reading Time: 2 mins read
       3
      Mmesoma Ejikeme, the 19-year-old candidate involved in the UTME result forgery, has appealed to the Registrar of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Ishaq Oloyede, to review the three years ban placed on her.
      
      Miss Ejikeme made the appeal on Wednesday during the investigative hearing organised by the ad hoc committee mandated by the House of Representatives to probe the forgery allegation against her.
      
      Background
      JAMB had accused Miss Ejikeme of manipulating her UTME results by inflating her score from 249 to 362.
      
      But the candidate insisted that the 362 was the score she received both on the JAMB website and in the SMS sent to her by the board.
      
      The examination body subsequently announced it would withdraw the candidate’s original UTME result and barred her from taking the test for the next three years.
      However, she subsequently admitted forging her scores during an investigation by an eight-member panel set up by Governor Charles Soludo of Anambra State. The panel discovered that Miss Ejikeme indeed forged the result.
  
      Amidst the controversy, the House waded into the saga by setting up a committee to investigate the matter. The House urged JAMB to suspend any punitive measure against the candidate pending the conclusion of the investigation by the House.
      
      The hearing
      Miss Ejikeme appeared before the Committee along with her father and lawyer to give her testimony.
